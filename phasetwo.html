</head>
<p>Between 1975 and 2000, not much progress was made<br>
  due to many winter periods taking place, during which<br>
  no progress took place. However, there was one event that allowed for<br>
  signficicant progress to take place. This was the game of chess which took place<br>
  between World Champion Garry Kasparov and the IBM Supercomputer<br>
  Deep Blue, in which Deep Blue triumphed.
