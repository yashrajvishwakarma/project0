  <p> The concept of Artificial Intelligence began with the great Alan Turing, whose invention of the<br>
    first computer would inspire him to write his paper, "Computing Machinery and Intelligence" in 1950, which would lead<br>
    to the creation of the term "Artificial Intelligence" for the first time in 1956 at the Dartmouth College Conference.
