  <p>From 2000 to present, we have been able to<br>
    take massive leaps of progress in our knowledge<br>
    of artificial intelligence. Similar to Deep Blue defeating<br>
    Kasparov, there were many landmark milestones in artificial<br>
    intelligence. For example, the first humanoid robot Sophia<br>
    was introduced in 2016, and in 2017, AlphaZero, a AI developed by<br>
    Deepmind at Google crushed Stockfish a chess engine at a game of<br>
    chess.<br>
